# SetRocmPowerAlways
This script is a simple workaround towards keeping a steady max power output value via the rocm-smi interface in an environment where multiple miners change the max output at different points in time. Tested with an rx570 amd gpu and should work in theory with any amd gpu that has rocr tools properly installed. WARNING: Always set the max power to a safe value that your gpu can handle!
